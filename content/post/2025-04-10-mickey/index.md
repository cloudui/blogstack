Oh, in the good old days when we only had innocent lil' Mickey Mouse and not this abomination of a film. The good ol' days when we watched a cute, cartoon, big-eared mouse driving a big ol' boat down the river rather than seeing Robert Pattinson and his clone get *freaky* with the same girl on a giant Trump spaceship flying toward an icy, alien planet full of giant roly polies with buttholes for faces.
