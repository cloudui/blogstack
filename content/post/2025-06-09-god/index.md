A little over a year ago, I wrote a short blog called ["What Makes a Person Bad?"](https://echen.io/shorts/bad-person/). I reasoned that "bad people" are individuals who "behav[e] consistently badly in certain situations or across multiple situations" with the caveat that they are unable to change. I believed that conclusion for a short amount of time, but in my more mature present state, I would like to put a microscope toward that question once again.

The question "What Makes a Person Bad?" perhaps has a more fundamental and deeper question within it that I barely addressed in the original post. That question being: what does "bad" even mean? We all have some shared notion of what it might mean: don't k*ll, don't harm, don't cheat, don't lie, don't steal, etc. But, those ideas of "badness" are relatively trivial. Each person draws different lines between good and bad, right and wrong. There are no two people on the planet who have precisely the same definition for good and bad, so what do good and bad even mean? 

Whoever I consider to be a good or bad person may not be in someone else's eyes, and vice versa. 

# A fundamental deep idea
There's a line the Declaration of Independence that we're all familiar with:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all men are created equal**, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. 

This idea was so fundemental to the founders that it embedded within the first few sentences in the doctrine that created the United States. It no doubt takes its origin from the Book of Genesis of the Bible:

> So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them

Like Jefferson, we may interpret that "all men are created equal" to be self evident, but I would argue this one idea is so deep and fundamental to society that without it, every moral statute in the world would fall apart.

The question begging to be asked is: why are all men created equal? Why are we all equal? On the surface, we clearly are not. Some people are prettier, richer, kinder, taller, skinnier, smarter, or abler. In fact, no one in the world is exactly the same as anyone else. We're all are clearly very different to the point where the only thing that we share in common is that we are all human. In that case, why are we treated as equals?

In the majority of history, people were not, and arguably, people are not today, either. There 



Even so, maybe the don't cheat, lie, etc. isn't as obvious as it seems, either
