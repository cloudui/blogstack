# Current Blog Theme!

This is the third iteration of my blog-- it's the current version available on my website: ![blog.echen.io](https://blog.echen.io). 

## A Brief History of Time
I originally made my website with Django and pure HTML. I had a WYSIWYG editor on a secret admin page (which you could just find in the source code...) where I could log in and make new posts/edits. It was a cute but relatively barebones website. I used a lot of what I learned from Pulsar Academy to construct it. 

After around a year, I decided to make the switch to Jekyll, a static site generator. I was happy with how easy it was to generate static pages, and I loved the customizability with Jekyll's built in Markdown engine. I spent MANY hours into customizing the Chirpy theme, making the website my own. I was really happy with the search features, layout, image embedding, and the refined design. 

I saw the Stack blog theme by Jimmy and immediately liked its bubbly and material design. I liked the card layout and font choices better than my Jekyll site. I made a quick switch to the new theme, which is hosted on Hugo rather than Jekyll-- another static generating site. The build times on Hugo are markedly faster, which made me instantly like it better than Jekyll. Hugo has image processing plugins, which is awesome, but is needlessly more complicated than the easy image rescaling of the Jekyll handler. Despite this, I still do like my new theme; hopefully, I'll have some more blog posts out soon! In the meantime, enjoy!
